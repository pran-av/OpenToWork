# Privacy Policy — Pitch Like This

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Published On:** January 7, 2026
**Last Updated On:** January 7, 2026

This document explains what we collect, why, how we protect it, who can see it, and how you can control it.

---

# 1 — Quick overview

* You create projects and campaigns.
* Live (Active) campaigns are accessible to anyone with the common “project link” (or UUID). Drafts are private. Paused campaigns stop being served but may have been copied while live.
* We store verified user emails and sign-in metadata; anonymous visitors get a browser JWT and are not personally identified.
* Leads (people who voluntarily fill forms on your campaign) are visible **only to you** in your dashboard.
* We use Supabase (DB), Vercel/Netlify (hosting), and Google Analytics (usage).
* No LLM trains on your data in the current live version of the app.
* For data deletion or privacy requests, email: [pranavdotexe@gmail.com](mailto:pranavdotexe@gmail.com) (from the email tied to your Pitch Like This account).

# 2 — Information we collect

* **Verified users (magic link via Supabase):**
  * Email (verified)
  * Account creation date
  * Last sign-in date
  * Authentication cookie/JWT for session management

* **Anonymous visitors (public campaign viewers):**
  * Browser JWT for session continuity (no personal identifier stored)

* **Usage & analytics:**
  * Page views, click events (Google Analytics)

* **Performance & errors:**
  * Hosting & platform logs (Supabase, Vercel, Netlify)

* **Service-specific / User-generated content (UGC):**
  * Projects, campaigns, case studies, services, CTAs (may include PII you enter)

* **Lead submissions (optional; provided by leads):**
  * Name, company, email, optional phone number — visible only to the project owner

---

# 3 — How we use information

* Verify users and enable authenticated features
* Provide, operate, and improve the service
* Maintain security and debug performance/errors
* Analyze aggregate usage for product improvement
* Send email updates for information that is necessary to be provided for continual of service or necessitated to be shared by the privacy and terms of service
* **We do NOT:** sell data, pool UGC into third-party datasets, or train LLMs on your data in the current live version of the app

---

# 4 — Publishing, campaigns, and public data — exact rules

* Projects: private by default. Only you (authenticated owner) can see your full project list.
* Campaign states — **Draft**, **Active**, **Paused**:
  * Draft: never public.
  * Active: publicly accessible to anyone with the “project” UUID or link. Content can include your CTAs.
  * Paused: removed from live serving; prior viewers may have cached/copied contents.
* Case studies are visible only when their campaign is Active.
* Do not publish NDA-restricted or private information.
* Leads are optional and visible only to the owner of the project in the dashboard.
* We do not track lead behavior (clicks/views) in the current version.

---

# 5 — Third-party services we use

* **Supabase** — database & authentication.
* **Vercel / Netlify** — hosting, CDN, edge runtime.
* **Google Analytics** — page view & click analytics.

---

# 6 — Data retention, deletion timeline & breach notification

* We retain data as needed to provide the service.
* **Deletion timeline:**
  * Account or project deletion requests are processed **within 30 days** of verified request (earlier where feasible).
  * Requests must be sent from the email associated with your Pitch Like This account.
* **Campaign caching reality:** Paused campaigns are unserved, but third-party or user-side cached copies may persist outside our control.
* **Breach notification:**
  * If a confirmed security incident meaningfully risks user data, affected users will be notified at their verified email **within 72 hours of confirmation**, subject to legal constraints. The notice will include scope, impact, and remediation steps.

---

# 7 — Security practices

* Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase tables with least-privilege access.
* Role-based access control is implemented for data access and governed under the Internal Database Querying Rules.
* Sensitive RPC endpoints are not publicly accessible; explicit application-authenticated routes only.
* Secure cookies and CSRF protection for client–DB communication.
* Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
* No LLM (including Supabase AI) is permitted to read or train on table contents in the current live version of the app.

Incident reporting follows the breach-notification terms above.

# 8 — Sharing & disclosure

* We do not sell personal data.
* Disclosure occurs only as necessary for:
  * Hosting/infra operations
  * Analytics
  * Legal requirements (with notice where not prohibited)

---

# 9 — Your rights & choices

* Access or copy your data.
* Correct inaccurate information.
* Delete account or specific projects (processed within 30 days).
* Opt-out of analytics (contact us).

# 10 — Cookies & tracking

* Secure authentication cookies.

# 15 — Internal Database Querying Policy

**Purpose:** prevent unauthorized access, misuse, and accidental leakage of user data.
**Principles:** least-privilege access, need-to-know, accountability, auditability, and separation of duties.

**Access rules**

* Role-based access control governs all privileged access.
* Temporary elevated access requires documented justification and approval under the internal rules.
* Contractors and future employees do not receive production data access unless explicitly approved and documented.

**Querying & operations**

* Queries are executed in staging unless a production operation is required and approved.
* Production queries must serve a documented product or support purpose under the internal rules.
* Exports of PII require explicit approval, documented purpose, and secure transfer consistent with the internal rules.

**Logging & monitoring**

* Privileged actions and production queries are logged with actor, time, and purpose.
* Logs are retained for an appropriate period to support accountability and investigations.

**Prohibited actions**

* Downloading or storing lead/user data on personal devices.
* Using data for non-product business purposes.
* Sharing PII over informal channels without authorization and appropriate protection.

**Emergency & incident handling**

* Break-glass access requires post-event justification and logging.
* Suspected incidents are escalated, contained, investigated, and notified per breach-notification terms.

**Review**

* Policy reviewed periodically and when major product changes occur.
* Continued use of product or services implies all users have acceptance towards the policy.

# 16 — Practical guidance (for users)

* Avoid publishing NDA-restricted or private information in campaigns.
* Assume paused content may exist in third-party caches.
* Use your account email when submitting deletion or privacy requests.
