# Landing Page

Unlike the Prelude Page and Pitch Page - the goal here is to make a very simple SaaS style website that is responsive for all mobile screen types, desktop and tablet.

## Design
Primary Poppins - use for Headings, Subheadings, Logos
Secondary Inter - use for CTA text, everything else

Color Theme: Sunrise Dawn. Warm. Trust. Excited. Optimistic. Use a pattern in the background as seems best to you. Make sure readability is 100% on all resolutions.

## Boiler Plate - P0

### Header: Name of the app "Pitch Like This". CTA "Create Your Pitch" on top right. For mobile have a shorter CTA name "Login". Fixed Header as user scrolls, for all platforms.

### Hero Section:

Desktop:
- Left and Right divide: 
Left Container Heading, Subheading and CTA
Right Container Product Image

Mobile and Tablet:
- Only single section (no image container): Heading, Subheading and CTA

The website only has hero section in P0 - so no scroll unless overflowing. Optimize for all viewport sizes.

Copy - same for both 

Heading: "You expertise in your Skills. We expertise in Selling your skills."

SubHeading: "Analyze the requirements, tailor your narrative, attach evidence, track responses — and stand out from the noise with specific, personalized pitches."

CTA Button: "Create Your Pitch" On Click user goes to: "https://www.pitchlikethis.com/auth"
