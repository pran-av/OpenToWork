# Deployment Checklist

1. Ensure there are non linter errors in the codebase
2. Ensure there are no potentially secret variables leaked in the code
3. Comment on the console log statements
4. Identify any functions or variables not in use and highlight them (do not remove them directly without notifying or warning)
